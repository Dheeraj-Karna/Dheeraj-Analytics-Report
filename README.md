Overview:
---------
Throughout this collection, I’ve analyzed structured datasets from various industries using robust data pipelines built with Pandas, enhanced through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques—primarily encapsulation and class-based modularity. I’ve paired these analyses with insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and outlier identification.

Projects Covered:
----------------
Movies Analysis
Sales Forecasting
Ecommerce Funnel
FastF1 Telemetry
Spotify Listening Trends
Superstore Insights

Each project was developed using real or demo data and includes a clear flow from data ingestion to final insights. Many modules were implemented using class structures to allow reusable analysis across datasets.

Technical Highlights:
---------------------
Python (Pandas, OOP, modular design)
Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib (bar, line, scatter, outlier detection)
Data Sources: CSV uploads, API integration, SDK samples, PostgreSQL queries
Tools & Platforms: Adobe Analytics, Looker Studio, Tableau
